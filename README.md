## About üìù

üîó [whatsapp-web.js](https://wwebjs.dev/)  
A WhatsApp client library for NodeJS that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app.

The project is a service that will send and receive whatsapp chat requests from a registered whatsapp account. The library uses `puppeteer` to run since whatsapp doesn't let any direct API calls aside from it's registered whatsapp for business APIs.  

This is a simple project to create a whatsapp web client using express and socket.io, with mongoose as an ODM (Object Document Model) to store session data since Whatsapp already stores the chats in its own internal database.
